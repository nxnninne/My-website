                <p>
                    My real name is Punyawee Khanthong, which means brave in Thai.
                    But honestly, it doesn't suit me at all. I’ve never truly lived
                    a brave life. I’m always wearing a mask, never showing my true
                    self or expressing how I really think and feel. I’m just terrified
                    that people will find out who I am—that I’m not strong, I’m not
                    heartless, and I’m not as capable as they think. I’m just a weak
                    person who feels worthless.In a way, my nickname 'Ninja' might fit me 
                    better than my real name. I haven't just been deceiving others; 
                    I’ve been deceiving myself too. By the time I realized that, 
                    it was already too late—so late that I find it hard to even forgive myself

                <h2>My Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    My goal is to achieve mastery in both Computer Science and Economics.
                    I don't want one to just supplement the other; I want to integrate
                    them to create a new field of science that the world hasn't fully
                    understood yet. I truly believe that this synergy will lead to a
                    major global transformation.
